	"description": "Soup Seeker is a Wordle spinoff (a \"souple\", if you will) that adds a slight twist to the regular Wordle formula. In Soup Seeker, players must not only guess the correct five-letter-word, but also choose the soup displayed on the screen with each word they concoct. Should they get nine soups correct without ever failing the Wordle, they become the Soup Lord; should they fail the Wordle without getting nine soups correct, they shall simply remain a soup-wolfing peasant.",
