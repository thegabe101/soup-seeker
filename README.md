## About

Soup Seeker is a Wordle spinoff (a "souple", if you will) that adds a slight twist to the regular Wordle formula. In Soup Seeker, players must not only guess the correct five-letter-word, but also choose the soup displayed on the screen with each word they concoct. Should they get nine soups correct without ever failing the Wordle, they become the Soup Lord; should they fail the Wordle without getting nine soups correct, they shall simply remain a soup-wolfing peasant.

### Why

I created Soup Seeker to work on two primary skillsets I consider vital to my growth as a starting developer:

    1. Becoming more comfortable in React, especially changing states across components, using useEffect, and using App Contexts.
    2. Becoming more comfortable with vanilla JavaScript puzzles and algorithms that encourage website interactivity, of which I wanted Soup Seeker to have plenty of.
